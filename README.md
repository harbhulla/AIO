In RS bot development, a decision tree structure organizes the bot’s logic in a hierarchical manner, where nodes represent conditions and branches guide actions based on game states. The decision tree enables efficient decision-making by breaking down complex tasks into simpler, manageable checks. For example, a woodcutting bot might use this structure to first decide if the player is near a tree, then check if an axe is equipped, and finally execute the woodcutting action. This method enhances the bot's responsiveness and adaptability by systematically prioritizing game actions based on real-time data.




For my All-In-One (AIO) RS bot, I’ve designed it to tackle a wide range of in-game tasks seamlessly. By employing a decision tree structure, the bot can adaptively switch between activities like combat, resource gathering, or skilling based on the game’s current conditions. I wanted the bot to be efficient and flexible, so it dynamically chooses the best action, whether that’s checking if equipment is ready, navigating to a target, or interacting with objects. This versatility makes it capable of managing complex automation tasks across different aspects of RS gameplay.
